# DNA-translation

# Overview 
- This Python program simulates the biological process of gene expression, converting a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.
  
- It performs two key steps:
  
Transcription → DNA to mRNA

Translation → mRNA to Protein

# Features 
- Converts a DNA sequence into its complementary mRNA strand
- Splits mRNA into codons
- Translates codons into amino acids using a dictionary
- Stops translation when a STOP codon is encountered
